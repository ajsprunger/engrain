# Engrain Assessment
By Austin Sprunger

In order to avoid exposing the API key on this public repository, I have removed it before committing. It will need to be re-inserted in the API-Key declaration on line 62. To run locally, run `php -S localhost:8000` in the terminal. Thank you for taking the time to look at my assessment.
